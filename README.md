# hc-stark — Height-Compressed, Streaming STARK Prover

`hc-stark` is a **height-compressed, sublinear-space STARK prover** designed to make **very long zero-knowledge proofs** practical on fixed-memory hardware (CPUs, GPUs, and edge devices).

It implements a **√T-space, streaming prover** for STARK-style proofs: instead of buffering the entire trace and all derived polynomials, the prover walks a **height-compressed computation tree** and recomputes small tiles on demand from compact checkpoints.

The result:

- **Prover memory:** ~√T (up to polylog factors) instead of T  
- **Prover time:** ~T · polylog²(T) (near-standard STARK time with a small replay overhead)  
- **Verifier & proof:** unchanged STARK-like (polylog(T) verification, polylog(T) proof size)  
- **Security:** transparent + hash-based (STARK-style, plausibly post-quantum)

## 1. What is this repo?

This repository is a **reference implementation** of a height-compressed STARK (hc-STARK) prover, meant to demonstrate:

- How to **recast a STARK prover** as a **height-compressible computation**.
- How to **tile** traces and polynomials into `√T`-sized blocks and **stream** over them.
- How to build a **pointerless DFS + replay engine** that achieves √T-space while preserving exact correctness.
- How to plug this into **real proving use cases**: zkVM traces, zkML workloads, and rollup batch proofs.

You can think of `hc-stark` as:

> “A provably correct, streaming, low-memory STARK engine that trades a bit of extra CPU for a quadratic reduction in prover RAM.”

---

## 2. What does hc-stark do?

At a high level, hc-STARK implements the standard STARK stack, but with a different **execution model**:

- **Input:**
  - A deterministic transition function (VM / AIR),
  - A finite execution trace of length `T`,
  - Public inputs/outputs, and a soundness / security parameter.

- **Output:**
  - A STARK-style proof that the trace satisfies the AIR constraints.
  - The proof is:
    - **Transparent** (no trusted setup),
    - **Hash-based** (plausibly post-quantum),
    - **Succinct** (polylog(T) size),
    - **Fast to verify** (polylog(T) time).

- **Key property:**  
  The **prover** runs in **sublinear space**: its peak working set scales like  
  `~ √T · polylog(T)` rather than `~ T`.

This unlocks proving regimes that are currently painful or impossible with in-core STARKs:

- zkVM traces with **10¹¹+ steps** on a single machine,
- zkML workloads where the **model + data** don’t fit in RAM,
- rollup batch proofs for **massive block sequences**, without mega-RAM boxes.

**Separation of concerns:**

* `hc-core` / `hc-poly` / `hc-merkle` / `hc-fri` implement **generic primitives** usable by other projects.
* `hc-air` + `hc-vm` define concrete **computations to prove** (VMs, example AIRs).
* `hc-prover` is where the **height compression logic lives**.
* `hc-verifier` is intentionally “boring”: as close as possible to a standard STARK verifier.

---

## 4. How the prover works (and why it meets the whitepaper desiderata)

### 4.1 Classic STARK pipeline (conceptually)

A “normal” in-core STARK prover does something like:

1. **Trace generation:**
   Materialize the full execution trace (T rows × k columns) in memory.

2. **AIR evaluation and composition polynomial:**

   * Interpolate polynomials over the trace domain.
   * Apply constraint polynomials to produce a composition polynomial.
   * Possibly extend to larger evaluation domains.

3. **Commitments:**

   * Perform FFTs / IFFTs over full vectors of length T (or larger).
   * Build Merkle trees for each oracle (trace, composition, FRI layers).

4. **Query answering:**

   * On verifier’s challenge indices, fetch rows / evaluations.
   * Return corresponding Merkle authentication paths and polynomial values.

All major steps treat the trace and polynomial oracles as **monolithic arrays** of size Θ(T). Memory usage is **Θ(T)**.

### 4.2 Height-compressed STARK pipeline

hc-STARK refactors this into a **height-compressed computation tree**:

1. **Block tiling:**

   * Choose a block size `b ≈ √T`.
   * Think of the trace as `T / b ≈ √T` **blocks** of size `b`.
   * Do the same for polynomial oracles, FRI layers, etc.

2. **Computation tree:**

   * Each logical “STARK step” (e.g., building a Merkle tree, running FRI) is represented as a **binary tree of block computations**.
   * Leaves correspond to block-local operations (FFT on a tile, hashing a range, etc.).
   * Internal nodes combine children (e.g., merge partial tree roots, propagate FRI layers).

3. **Height compression + pointerless DFS:**

   * Reshape the natural left-deep tree into a **balanced binary tree** whose depth is **O(log T)**.
   * Traverse this tree with a **pointerless DFS**:

     * No explicit heap-allocated tree,
     * Just a small **stack of frames** (one per level),
     * Each frame holds at most O(1) “checkpoints” (hashes, random coins, block indices).

4. **Replay engine:**

   * Instead of keeping all blocks live, hc-STARK:

     * Stores **only O(1)** block(s) of size `b` at a time,
     * Recomputes blocks from nearby checkpoints using the VM/AIR and polynomial primitives.
   * Whenever a block is needed again (e.g., for answering queries or building higher FRI layers), it is **replayed** from checkpoints with **O(b)** working memory.

By choosing `b ≈ √T`, the prover’s peak space becomes:

* `O(b) + O(log T)` stack overhead,
* ⇒ **~√T · polylog(T)** in total.

### 4.3 Complexity summary (hc-STARK itself)

Let `T` be the trace length / domain size.

* **Prover space:**

  * Live block size: `b ≈ √T`
  * DFS stack: `O(log T)` small frames
  * ⇒ `Space_prover = ~O(√T · polylog T)`

* **Prover time:**

  * Each block: `~O(b · polylog b)` work,
  * Number of blocks: `~T / b ≈ √T`,
  * Some blocks are replayed along O(log T) tree height,
  * ⇒ conservative bound `Time_prover = ~O(T · log² T)`

* **Verifier & proof:**

  * Comparable to a standard STARK:

    * `Time_verifier = polylog(T)`
    * `Proof_size = polylog(T)`

---

## 5. Complexity & properties: hc-STARK vs other proving systems

This section compares hc-STARK against several prevailing ZKP paradigms along:

* **Asymptotic prover time**
* **Asymptotic prover space**
* **Verifier time**
* **Proof size**
* **Transparency** (trusted setup or not)
* **Post-quantum safety**

Let `T` denote the “size” of the computation (e.g., number of steps in a VM trace, or circuit size).

### 5.1 Side-by-side comparison

> Asymptotics hide polylog factors; we use `~O(·)` to mean “up to polylog(T)”.

| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------ | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **hc-STARK (this repo)**                  | `~O(T · log² T)`    | `~O(√T)`     | `~O(polylog T)`                           | `~O(polylog T)`   | **Yes**                | **Yes (hash-based; STARK-style assumptions)** | Streaming, √T-space; inherits STARK guarantees.        |
| **In-core STARK**                         | `~O(T · log T)`     | `O(T)`       | `~O(polylog T)`                           | `~O(polylog T)`   | **Yes**                | **Yes (hash-based; STARK-style assumptions)** | Classic design; RAM is the bottleneck.                 |
| **Pairing SNARK (Groth16/Plonk)**         | `~O(T · polylog T)` | `O(T)`       | `~O(1)` group ops + `polylog T` field ops | `O(1)` (constant) | **No** (needs SRS)     | **No** (EC pairings / discrete log)           | Tiny proofs; great verification; heavy setup & non-PQ. |
| **IPA/Bulletproof-style SNARKs**          | `~O(T · log T)`     | `O(T)`       | `~O(polylog T)`                           | `~O(log T)`       | Often **Yes** (no SRS) | **No** (discrete log)                         | Small proofs; no trusted setup; prover still O(T) RAM. |
| **PCP/IOP with generic hash commitments** | `~O(T · polylog T)` | `O(T)`       | `~O(polylog T)`                           | `~O(polylog T)`   | **Yes**                | **Yes (hash-based)**                          | Conceptual baseline for STARK-like systems.            |

* “Post-quantum safe?” here means: **no known polynomial-time quantum attacks under common assumptions**.
Hash-based, STARK-style systems are currently considered **much more “future-proof”** than discrete-log / pairing-based systems.

### 5.2 How hc-STARK fits into the landscape

* **vs In-core STARKs (same family):**

  * **Same security & cryptographic assumptions.**
  * **Same transparency**: no trusted setup.
  * **Same general prover/verifier interface**, same AIR / IOP structure.
  * **Key difference:** hc-STARK changes the **computational regime**:

    * RAM: `O(T)` → `~O(√T)`,
    * Time: `~O(T log T)` → `~O(T log² T)` (extra log factor from replay).
  * If RAM is cheap and T is moderate: classic STARKs win on simplicity.
  * If T is huge and RAM is the bottleneck: hc-STARK unlocks proofs that otherwise don’t fit at all.

* **vs Pairing-based SNARKs (Groth16/Plonk):**

  * SNARKs offer:

    * **Tiny proofs (constant size)**,
    * **Extremely fast verification**, great for on-chain verification.
  * But:

    * Require a **trusted setup** (universal or per-circuit SRS),
    * Rely on **elliptic-curve pairings / discrete log** ⇒ vulnerable to **quantum attacks** (Shor).
    * Prover still typically uses **O(T)** memory (large polynomials, FFTs, MSMs).
  * hc-STARK chooses the opposite trade-off:

    * Proofs are larger (polylog(T) rather than constant),
    * Verifier is slightly heavier (though still polylog(T)),
    * In exchange, you get **transparent, hash-based, PQ-friendly** security and **√T-space** provers.

* **vs IPA/Bulletproof-style systems:**

  * Bulletproofs and some IPA SNARKs are:

    * **Transparent or updatable** (no per-circuit SRS),
    * Have **logarithmic proof size**,
    * But still rely on EC discrete log ⇒ **not PQ safe**.
  * Prover memory is still effectively **O(T)**, because the underlying representation is vector-based.
  * hc-STARK again trades slightly larger proofs for:

    * **Hash-only assumptions**,
    * **Sublinear prover memory**.

### 5.3 Which use cases benefit the most from hc-STARK?

The √T-space design is especially valuable where:

* **T is enormous** (zkVMs, zkML, long-running off-chain compute, rollup batch proofs), and:
* **RAM / VRAM is the true bottleneck**, not raw compute cycles.

Concrete examples:

* zkRollups with **massive block batches** on commodity cloud machines,
* zkVMs with **billions of steps** running on a single GPU,
* zkML proving for large models and large batched inputs, where activation traces don’t fit in RAM,
* Verifiable off-chain compute platforms that want to run on **fixed-memory hardware tiers**.

In that regime, hc-STARK:

> *“Moves you from ‘what can I prove with my RAM?’ to ‘what can I prove with my CPU/GPU cycles?’”*

which is often the **more scalable and cloud-friendly axis to spend money on**.

## 6. How to use hc-STARK (once the implementation is complete)

> **Note:** The exact commands and crate names may differ slightly depending on how you wire things up. Treat this as a blueprint.

### 6.1 Building and running examples

```bash
# Build everything
cargo build --workspace

# Run a simple zkVM example (e.g., Fibonacci)
cargo run -p hc-examples --bin zkvm_fib_prove

# Verify the corresponding proof
cargo run -p hc-examples --bin zkvm_fib_verify
```

Quick smoke tests via our CLI:

```bash
cargo run -p hc-cli -- prove
cargo run -p hc-cli -- verify
cargo run -p hc-cli -- bench --iterations 5
```

You might expose flags like:

```bash
cargo run -p hc-examples --bin zkvm_fib_prove \
  -- --steps 100000000 \
     --block-size 10000 \
     --security-level 128 \
     --output proof.bin
```

### 6.2 Extending the system with a new AIR / VM

To define a new computation:

1. Implement a **VM / transition function** in `hc-vm` or a similar crate:

   * Define the state representation,
   * Implement “next state” and boundary conditions.

2. Define the corresponding **AIR** in `hc-air`:

   * Number of trace columns,
   * Constraint polynomials,
   * Boundary constraints, degree bounds, etc.

3. Wire it into `hc-prover`:

   * Implement a small adapter that:

     * Generates a trace stream,
     * Exposes “block replay” hooks (how to regenerate a block from a checkpoint).

4. Add an **example binary** in `examples/` that:

   * Constructs public inputs,
   * Runs the prover,
   * Serializes a proof,
   * Runs the verifier.

### 6.3 Benchmarking the time/space trade-off

Use the `benches/space_time` harness (or your own) to compare:

* hc-STARK vs a baseline in-core STARK prover, for the same AIR / trace.
* Measure:

  * Peak RSS (RAM),
  * Total runtime,
  * CPU/GPU utilization.

This demonstrates the **√T-space behavior** and the **polylogarithmic time overhead** empirically. The `hc-bench` and `hc-cli bench` helpers give you a repeatable harness for micro-benchmarks without wiring up your own scripts.

## 8. Development standards (TL;DR)

See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full checklist. Highlights:

- **Toolchain:** Rust `stable`, `cargo fmt --all`, `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`, `cargo test --workspace --all-targets`, `cargo doc --workspace --no-deps`.
- **Safety:** All crates use `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`. Prefer pure functions and explicit data ownership.
- **Error handling:** Use `hc_core::HcError`, `HcResult<T>`, and the `hc_ensure!` macro; never `panic!` in library code.
- **Docs:** Every module starts with a `//!` overview and updates the relevant note under `docs/design_notes/`.
- **Benchmarks:** Keep `hc-bench` scenarios deterministic so nightly CI can compare regressions.

Following these guardrails ensures we ship a world-class, production-ready hc-STARK stack without regressing on correctness or security.

---

## 9. Current snapshot

- ✅ Minimal AIR/VM/prover/verifier pipeline backed by deterministic replay.
- ✅ CLI (`hc-cli`), examples (`hc-examples`), and benchmarking harness (`hc-bench`).
- ✅ Recursive aggregator scaffolding plus GPU-ready FFT backend trait (`hc_core::fft::backend::FftBackend`).
- ✅ Full workspace tests via `cargo test --workspace`.
- 🔄 Next: richer circuits, true streaming Merkle/FRI proofs, GPU acceleration, and hardened proof serialization.

If you’re interested in collaborating, extending this design, or plugging hc-STARK into your zk stack (rollups, zkML, verifiable compute), the structure of this repo is meant to make that as straightforward as possible: you get a **future-proof, transparent, PQ-friendly ZKP engine** with a **provably sublinear-space prover** as a first-class architectural primitive.
